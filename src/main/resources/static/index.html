<!--
    This HTML code contains a "meta refresh" tag, which facilitates automatic redirection of the page.
    The "meta" tag is used to define metadata within the page.

    The "http-equiv" attribute is used to mimic specific HTTP headers. In this case, it mimics the "refresh" header.

    The "content" attribute determines the duration for the page to refresh and specifies the target URL.
    It indicates that the page will be redirected to the 'employees/list' URL after 0 seconds (immediately).

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL='employees/list'">
